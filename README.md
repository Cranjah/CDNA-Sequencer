### Video Demo: [Click here to get forwarded to YouTube video demonstration](https://youtu.be/LBu73txCqSA?si=ZXypzAd-9SSb1Uhx)

### Description of the Functionalities:

See the next days for description of all the functionalities of the program!

### Disclaimer:

**This terminal program was created for my own learning / education purposes only! Why? Because the inputs of the program are so far limited to 1023 letters and with this to 1023 bases - but genes, genomes and in general DNA strings can be much longer, what makes this terminal program somewhat useless for scientific research purposes - even if the functions and formulas might work correctly in cases of shortened and limited inputs. If you need a serious application for bioinformatics, there are many providers available online - just look it up. I hope you still enjoy my application!**
